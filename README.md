# CryptographyWinApp
Application created in C# and Windows Forms to understand modern cryptography methods and algorithms

Important classes:
- AES.cs - class for encrypting and decrypting byte[] data with AES algorithm
- RSA.cs - class for encrypting and decrypting byte[] data with RSA algorithm
- Enkripcija.cs - containing methods and data necessary for previous explained classes (for example AES key, public and private key for RSA...)

Instructions:
- Open .sln file in Visual Studio -> Build and Run
